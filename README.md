# NG_datasets
The data are uploaded as a .mat file. They consist of longitude and latitude denoted by lon_lat, climate zone according to Köppen-Geiger climate classification denoted by climzone, lithology (Hartmann and Moosdorf, 2012) denoted by lith, river channel steepness index (Hilley et al., 2019) denoted by ksn, soil thickness (available at https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=1304) denoted by soil_thickness, topsoil organic carbon and available water capacity obtained from HWSD 2.0 denoted by carbon and awc, respectively, and vegetation stability index calculated from remote sensing-based vegetation datasets (available at https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod13c2v006/) denoted by cv_evi. All datasets were resampled into the 0.05° resolution.
Climate zone: 1-tropical zone; 2-arid zone; 3-subtropical zone; 4-temperate zone; 5-sub-frigid zone.
Lithology: 1-us; 2-pc; 3-mc; 4-ss; 5-ev; 6-mt; 7-pl; 8-vc.
