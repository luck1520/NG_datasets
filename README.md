# Science_datasets
The data are uploaded as a .mat file. They consist of longitude and latitude denoted by lon_lat, climate indicators: mean annual precipitation (P), air temperature (T), and aridity index (AI) covering 2001-2020, lithology (Hartmann and Moosdorf, 2012) denoted by lith, river channel steepness index (Hilley et al., 2019) denoted by ksn, current tectonic intensity (Kreemer, 2014) denoted by sr, soil thickness (available at https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=1304) denoted by st, topsoil organic carbon and available water capacity obtained from HWSD 2.0 denoted by carbon and awc, respectively, vegetation stability index calculated from remote sensing-based vegetation datasets (available at https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod13c2v006/) denoted by cvi_cv and its residuals cvi_cv'. All datasets were resampled into the 0.05Â° resolution. 
Lithology: 1-us; 2-pc; 3-mc; 4-ss; 5-ev; 6-mt; 7-pl; 8-vc.
