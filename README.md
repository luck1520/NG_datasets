# Science_datasets
The data are uploaded as a .mat file. They consist of longitude and latitude denoted by lon_lat, climate indicators: mean annual precipitation (ave_P), air temperature (ave_T), evapotranspiration (ave_PET), and aridity index (ave_AI) covering 2001-2020, lithology (Hartmann and Moosdorf, 2012) denoted by lith, river channel steepness index (Hilley et al., 2019) denoted by ksn, soil thickness (available at https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=1304) denoted by st, topsoil organic carbon and available water capacity obtained from HWSD 2.0 denoted by carbon and awc, respectively, mean annual vegetaion index (ave_EVI) and vegetation stability index calculated from remote sensing-based vegetation datasets (available at https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod13c2v006/) denoted by cvi_cv and its residuals cvi_cv2. All datasets were resampled into the 0.05Â° resolution. 
Lithology: 1-us; 2-pc; 3-mc; 4-ss; 5-ev; 6-mt; 7-pl; 8-vc.
